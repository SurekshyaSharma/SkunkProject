# p.1.1: 
  ## Add the class SkunkApp with a main() method to your project. Throughout the project, this should be the starting point for running an interactive game of Skunk. 
  ## For now, have main() use StdOut.println() to print a welcome message (don't forget the import statement described above). 
  ## Then create a Dice instance, invoke roll() against it, then print out the resulting value. 

# p.1.2:
## You should implement SkunkApp with starting main() and other classes so that your app plays one complete interactive turn of Skunk with one human player.
## (You don't have to implement this as part of a larger game, but it's ok if you do.  But just one player in this Phase, please.)
## The UI should report to the user each roll's outcome within an ongoing turn, as well as a final end-of-turn summary when the turn is over.  Roll outcome reporting should include the name of the player, the value of each thrown die within a roll of the dice, what kind of Skunk (single/deuce/double) is thrown (if any), and the current turn score thus accumulated for the player.  The final end-of-turn summary should include the player's name, the complete sequence of roll outcomes during the turn, their final turn score, and how many chips they lost in the turn. 

# p.1.3 :
## Extend your SkunkApp so it plays a complete Game of Skunk, consisting of one or more Turns and ending when one (or more) players reach 100,
## with others given one more Turn to beat the high score(s).
## remaining: Make the dynamic for multiple players, right now the games playes for 3 players max
## The remaining chip values is not correct for more than 2 players
